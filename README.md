# Job Salary Analysis
Analysis of a job vacancies dataset. Exploration of salary dependence on various factors. Visualization and development of a regression model.

Data for this project includes job vacancies (data jobs). Link to the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephgutstadt/data-jobs)

The project involved data cleaning (removal of unnecessary data, handling and imputing missing values, and formatting), categorizing job vacancies into categories using classification based on job titles and descriptions in the dataset, and extracting additional information from job descriptions using regular expressions. Data visualizations were created, and an XGBoost regression model was developed on the cleaned dataset. The modelâ€™s feature importance was also visualized to highlight the key factors identified by the model.

Also there are interactive visualizations [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/6225WSQZC?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
